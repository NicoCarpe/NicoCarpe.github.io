Hi, I'm Nicolas! I recently graduated from the University of Alberta with a degree in computer science, and I've just moved back to my hometown of Vancouver, Canada, from campus in Edmonton.

During university, I was always fascinated by one of my friend's courses in Neuroscience, so I decided to pursue some of those same classes as electives alongside my computer science major and mathematics minor. Despite the difficulty of learning cellular neuroscience, it was all worth it when I reached the fourth-year class on both the basic science and clinical aspects of age-related neurodegenerative disorders.

Having built up a relatively unique combination of classes, I wanted to find other like-minded people and ended up becoming an executive member of the Artificial Intelligence in Medical Systems Society (AIMSS) at my university.

Through a combination of working in several labs, my coursework, and organizing a symposium with AIMSS, I discovered my niche: machine learning applications in medical imaging. Since then, I have fallen in love with the field and constantly look for ways to contribute.

Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy playing sportsâ€”almost any of them. Recently, I've been particularly enjoying ultimate frisbee, rowing, fencing, and volleyball.
